# Playlister, Part I

### Skills: Object Oriented Programming, Test Driven Development

## Instructions

Fork this repository, clone it, and make the RSpec tests pass.

1. Create a Class for `song`, `artist`, and `genre`. Use an individual file for each class. These files should be placed within a `lib` directory.

2. Implement the code that makes all of the RSpec tests in the `spec` directory pass. Don't forget to include any necessary files!

3. Implement the pending tests (in `spec/song_spec.rb`) and make them pass too.
